# NBA Sports Betting Using Machine Learning 🏀

A machine learning AI used to predict the winners and under/overs of NBA games. Takes all team data from the 2007-08 season to current season, matched with odds of those games, using a neural network to predict winning bets for today's games. Achieves ~69% accuracy on money lines and ~55% on under/overs. Outputs expected value for teams money lines to provide better insight. The fraction of your bankroll to bet based on the Kelly Criterion is also outputted. Note that a popular, less risky approach is to bet 50% of the stake recommended by the Kelly Criterion.
## Packages Used

Use Python 3.11. In particular the packages/libraries used are...

* Tensorflow - Machine learning library
* XGBoost - Gradient boosting framework
* Numpy - Package for scientific computing in Python
* Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
* Colorama - Color text output
* Tqdm - Progress bars
* Requests - Http library
* Scikit_learn - Machine learning library

## Usage

<img src="https://github.com/kyleskom/NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting/blob/master/Screenshots/Expected_value.png" width="1010" height="424" />

Make sure all packages above are installed.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kyleskom/NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting.git
$ cd NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 main.py -xgb -odds=fanduel
```

Odds data will be automatically fetched from sbrodds if the -odds option is provided with a sportsbook.  Options include: fanduel, draftkings, betmgm, pointsbet, caesars, wynn, bet_rivers_ny

If `-odds` is not given, enter the under/over and odds for today's games manually after starting the script.

Optionally, you can add '-kc' as a command line argument to see the recommended fraction of your bankroll to wager based on the model's edge

## One-command pipeline runner

To refresh the raw data, rebuild the enriched dataset, retrain the models, and produce today's predictions in one go, use the `pipeline.py` helper:

```bash
python pipeline.py --odds fanduel --models xgb --kelly
```

The script mirrors the manual steps documented below and accepts a few useful flags:

* `--skip-team-data` / `--skip-odds-data` / `--skip-dataset` / `--skip-training` / `--skip-predictions` – skip individual phases when you already have the latest outputs.
* `--models xgb nn` – run both the XGBoost and neural network predictors (omit `nn` to run just XGBoost).
* `--odds <sportsbook>` – forward the sportsbook to `main.py` so odds are scraped automatically.
* `--kelly` – enable Kelly Criterion staking recommendations during the prediction step.
* `--dry-run` – print the commands without executing them; helpful for verifying the workflow.

Make sure the required API keys (e.g., `BALLDONTLIE_API_KEY`) are exported in your environment before launching the pipeline so the feature engineering step can call external services.

## Flask Web App
<img src="https://github.com/kyleskom/NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting/blob/master/Screenshots/Flask-App.png" width="922" height="580" />

This repo also includes a small Flask application to help view the data from this tool in the browser.  To run it:
```
cd Flask
flask --debug run
```

## Getting new data and training models
```
# Create dataset with the latest data for 2023-24 season
cd src/Process-Data
python -m Get_Data
python -m Get_Odds_Data
python -m Create_Games

# Train models
cd ../Train-Models
python -m XGBoost_Model_ML
python -m XGBoost_Model_UO
```
